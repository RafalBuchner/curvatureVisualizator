# Curvature Visualizator

I must give credit to the amazing  [`Primer on Bézier curves`](https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/) and [SpeedPunk](https://github.com/yanone/speedpunk), as they were instrumental in creating this repository. Although it may appear similar, the code is tailored specifically to its creator, making it more intuitive to use. Additionally, it only operates within the RoboFont environment, which simplifies the process. Thanks to this, incorporating support for quadratic curves was a straightforward task, unlike SpeedPunk which currently lacks this feature.

## How does it work?

Basically, it adds a menu-item to the `Display…` menu of the Glyph Edit Window.![menu_item](image/menu_item.png)

All you need to do is activate it.

Additional options you will find in the `options` button that will appear in the bottom-right part of the Glyph Edit Window. 

Even more, settings you will find in the `Extensions` menu.

A cool feature is `zoom visualization`, which will scale the whole curvature representation together with the zoom factor of your Glyph Edit Window.
